# Fractal React Typewriter Effect

This is a package that gives your text a typing effect, with extra features like looping multitext and callback functions on text change! Forked from [kevoese/react-typewriter-effect](https://github.com/kevoese/react-typewriter-effect).

**Reason for Fork**

Fix a few bugs to make the package loop multitext and display properly over multilines text. Note that we, Fractal, no longer use this package but instead use our own internal version within our internal TypeScript library. This package is left here for those who find use from it, but will not be maintained.

## Description

This package lets you create a typewriting effect for text elements.

![Typewriter description](./images/singleTextDisplay1.gif)

Typewriter Effect animates when the component is in view. By default, it uses the document reference to check if the component is in view or not; but you can pass the `ref` object which is scrollable to the `scollArea` props.

**For example**

```
const myRef = document.querySelector('.scrollable-div')

<TypeWriterEffect width="230" trackWidth="13" percentage={score} scrollArea={myRef}/>
```

**Otherwise**

If `scrollArea` is not defined, the document reference object is used.

## Set up

To use the package, start by installing the package on your React project file with:

```
npm i react-typewriter-effect
```

### For a single text display

```
import TypeWriterEffect from 'react-typewriter-effect';

 <TypeWriterEffect
            textStyle={{ fontFamily: 'Red Hat Display' }}
            startDelay={100}
            cursorColor="black"
            text="This is a single text"
            typeSpeed={100}
            scrollArea={myAppRef}
          />

```

#### Output

![single text display](./images/textDisplay.gif)

### For a multiple text display

Set the `multiText` props to an array of strings which are displayed sequentially.

```
import TypeWriterEffect from 'react-typewriter-effect';

     <TypeWriterEffect
        textStyle={{
          fontFamily: 'Red Hat Display',
          color: '#3F3D56',
          fontWeight: 500,
          fontSize: '1.5em',
        }}
        startDelay={2000}
        cursorColor="#3F3D56"
        multiText={[
          'Hey there, This is a type writer animation package',
          'it consist of two types...',
          'Single text display and multi text display',
          'Fonts can be customized.',
          'The type speed can be customized as well',
        ]}
        loop={true}
        nextTextDelay={1000}
        typeSpeed={30}
      />
```

#### Output
